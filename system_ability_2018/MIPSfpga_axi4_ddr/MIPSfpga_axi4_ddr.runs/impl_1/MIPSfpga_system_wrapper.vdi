The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (CFGBVS-1) Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties - Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (REQP-1709) Clock output buffering - PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal MIPSfpga_system_i/mig_7series_0/u_MIPSfpga_system_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the MIPSfpga_system_i/mig_7series_0/u_MIPSfpga_system_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of MIPSfpga_system_i/mig_7series_0/u_MIPSfpga_system_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (RTSTAT-10) No routable loads - 1 net(s) have no routable loads. The problem bus(es) and/or net(s) are JB7_IBUF.
