CRITICAL WARNING: [Netlist 29-160] Cannot set property 'PACKAGE_PIN', because the property does not exist for objects of type 'pin'. [c:/Users/HUALONG/Desktop/SmartCar/system_ability_2018/MIPSfpga_axi4_ddr/MIPSfpga_axi4_ddr.srcs/sources_1/ipshared/xilinx.com/motordriver_v1_0/ef537a2d/MotorDirver.srcs/constrs_1/new/Nexys-4-DDR-Master.xdc:7]
Resolution: Modify the set_property command to apply the property on the correct object type. Since the property is being applied as a scoped constraint, ensure the proper connectivity of the object port objects can be translated into pin objects. This could be due to the insertion of IO Buffers between the top level terminal and cell pin. If the goal is to apply constraints that will migrate to top level ports it is required that IO Buffers manually be instanced.

Phase 2.1.2 IO & Clk Clean Up
WARNING: [Place 30-574] Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	JB4_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to IOB_X0Y120
	MIPSfpga_system_i/util_ds_buf_0/U0/USE_BUFG.GEN_BUFG[0].BUFG_U (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y1
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.

INFO: [DRC 23-27] Running DRC with 2 threads
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLCK-12) Clock Placer Checks - Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	MIPSfpga_system_i/util_ds_buf_0/U0/USE_BUFG.GEN_BUFG[0].BUFG_U (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y1
